How often the Postfix queue manager's scheduler is allowed to preempt delivery of one message with another.[br]
Each transport maintains a so-called "available delivery slot counter" for each message.[br]
One message can be preempted by another one when the other message can be delivered using no more delivery slots (i.e., invocations of delivery agents) than the current message counter has accumulated (or will eventually accumulate - see about slot loans below). This parameter controls how often is the counter incremented - it happens after each default_delivery_slot_cost recipients have been delivered.[br]
The cost of 0 is used to disable the preempting scheduling completely.[br]
The minimum value the scheduling algorithm can use is 2 - use it if you want to maximize the message throughput rate.[br]
Although there is no maximum, it doesn't make much sense to use values above say 50.[br]
The only reason why the value of 2 is not the default is the way this parameter affects the delivery of mailing-list mail.[br]
In the worst case, their delivery can take somewhere between (cost+1/cost) and (cost/cost-1) times more than if the preemptive scheduler was disabled.[br]
The default value of 5 turns out to provide reasonable message response times while making sure the mailing-list deliveries are not extended by more than 20-25 percent even in the worst case.

 typically to improve storage utilization.[br]
 In the deduplication process, duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be stored, along with references to the unique copy of data.[br]
 Deduplication is able to reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored.[br]
Data deduplication increases the speed of service and reduces costs.[br]
The benefits from data deduplication start with increasing overall data integrity and end with reducing overall data protection costs.[br]
Data deduplication lets users reduce the amount of disk they need for backup by 90 percent or more, and with reduced acquisition costs—and reduced power, space, and cooling requirements.[br]
Deduplication can also provide significant energy, space, cooling and costs savings, by reducing the amount of data stored. It contributes significantly in the process of Data Center Transformation through reducing carbon footprints due to savings on storage space and reduces the recurring cost of human resource to management and administration.[br]

If running the 32-bit hugemem kernel isn't an option either, you can try

Processes commonly allocate memory by calling the function malloc().[br]
The kernel decides if enough RAM is available and either grants or denies the allocation request.[br]
Linux (and a few other Unix-variants) support the ability to over-commit memory; that is, to permit more memory to be allocated than is available 
in physical RAM plus swap.[br]
This is scary, but sometime necessary since applications commonly allocate memory for "worst case" scenarios but never use it.
";s:19:"vm.overcommit_ratio";s:1233:"
Percentage of memory that is allowed for overcommit.[br]Default is 50.[br]
It represents the percentage of physical RAM that along with the entire swap forms the total address space (allocatable memory).[br]
Yes, the naming is confusing, since there is no overcommitting.[br]
The default is 50 so, quite unintuitively, only half of the RAM will be used.[br]
Seeing that the swap is the only component that can change dynamically it would have made sense to specify a percentage for that.[br]
Anyway, there are 2 ways to ensure that the allocatable memory will be equal to the RAM size:[br]
1. make the swap the same size as the RAM and set vm.overcommit_ratio=0 - that will work as long as the swap is in use, 
but as soon as a swapoff is done (manually or during shutdown), you're in for a nasty surprise: no more memory can be allocated.[br]
At all! New programs will fail to start.[br][br]
2. Set vm.overcommit_ratio=100 and disable the swap.[br]
This is a stable setup and the preferred method on a machine with enough RAM.[br]
Web servers are slowed down anyway by swapping and careful planning will help ensuring that the memory 
usage limits won't be reached (by setting cache sizes, maximum number of processes, etc.).

It is difficult to know when this should be changed, other than by experimentation.[br]The slabtop command (part of the package procps) shows top memory objects used 
by the kernel.[br]The vfs caches are the "dentry" and the "*_inode_cache" objects.[br]
If these are consuming a large amount of memory in relation to pagecache, it may be worth trying to increase pressure.[br]
Could also help to reduce swapping. The default value is 100.

appropriate for your setup/server.[br]
Each time a request on an item can be found in the cache (cache hits), this avoids calls to other processes and disks/storage.[br]
Setting sensible cache settings certainly increases the performance.[br]
In a server purely running Zarafa, it is advisable to set caches to use around 80% (in total -- including MySQL) 
of the RAM available in your server and can be considered to be a rule-of-thumb.[br]
The other 20% should be free for system processes, other processes (like your MTA) and the web server.[br]
Whenever you set the values too high this can result in the use of swap on your server.[br]
Swapping should be avoided, but we do want to make use of the RAM available.[br]
Therefore these settings should be a healthy balance between the risk of swapping and efficient caching in memory.

This is the main cache used in Zarafa.[br]
It caches all data that comes into view in tables (e.g. the view of your inbox, or any other folder).[br]

for data when browsing through folders, but this would require around 1.5K per message item (email, appointment task, etc)

 redundant Mail Protocol service hosts, e.g., by managing the Domain Name System's (DNS) 
 responses to address requests from Mail server according to an appropriate statistical model.[br]
In its simplest implementation Round-robin DNS works by responding to DNS requests not only with a single IP address,[br]
 but a list of IP addresses of several servers that host identical services.[br]
The order in which IP addresses from the list are returned is the basis for the term round robin.[br]
 With each DNS response, the IP address sequence in the list is permuted. Usually, basic IP clients attempt connections with the first 
address returned from a DNS query so that on different connection attempts clients would receive service from different providers, thus distributing the overall load among servers.

The DHCP server will normally assume that the configuration information about a given network segment is not known to be correct 
and is not authoritative.[br]
This is so that if a naive user installs a DHCP server not fully understanding how to configure it,
 it does not send spurious DHCPNAK messages to clients that have obtained addresses from a legitimate DHCP server on the network.[br]
Network administrators setting up authoritative DHCP servers for their networks should always use authoritative to indicate that the DHCP server should 
send DHCPNAK messages to misconfigured clients.[br]
If this is not done, clients will be unable to get a correct IP address after changing subnets until their old lease has expired, 
which could take quite a long time.[br]
However, if a DHCP server is to be set up so that it is aware of some networks for which it is authoritative and 
some networks for which it is not, it may be more appropriate to declare authority on a per-network-segment basis.[br]
Note that the most specific scope for which the concept of authority makes any sense is the physical network segment 
- either a shared-network statement or a subnet statement that is not contained within a shared-network statement[↓r]
It is not meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some subnets within a shared network, 
but not authoritative for others, nor is it meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some 
host declarations and not others.

The address byte 0 means that the mask allows for any value in the clients' IP
address in that position; e.g., 192.168.0.0 would allow 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, and so on or 0.0.0.0 Will ban all addresses[br]
When access control lists for allowing and for denying are in place, then the allow-list is
evaluated first.[br]
If a client does not matches the white list, then the deny list is evaluated.[br]

most mail server software can be configured to reject or flag messages which have been sent from a site listed on one or

DNSBL is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy.[br]
There are dozens of DNSBLs in existence,which use a wide array of criteria for listing and delisting of addresses.[br]

Apache can be configured in both a forward and reverse proxy mode.[br]
An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server.[br]
In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target 
and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client.[br]
The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.[br]
A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a firewall

Soft limits allow for greater sharing of memory.[br]
The idea behind soft limits is to allow control groups to use as much of the memory as needed, provided
[br]
a. There is no memory contention[br]
b. They do not exceed their hard limit[br]
[br]
When the system detects memory contention or low memory, control groups
are pushed back to their soft limits.[br]If the soft limit of each control
group is very high, they are pushed back as much as possible to make
sure that one control group does not starve the others of memory.[br]
Please note that soft limits is a best effort feature, it comes with
no guarantees, but it does its best to make sure that when memory is
heavily contended for, memory is allocated based on the soft limit
hints/setup.

When this is set the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file 
is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file
 is created or extended to be a given size.[br]
In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.[br]
This can be slow on some systems.[br]
When you work with large files like >100MB or so you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts.[br]
When you have an extent based filesystem it's likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba
 to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate.[br]
 With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas.[br]
 Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation.[br]
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents.[br]
On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will 
see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files.[br]
Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems

The accounting department, for example, might have an accounting server, and clients of it would see just the accounting disks and printers. The marketing department could have their own server, marketing, with their own reports, and so on. However,

 Consequently, name registration and resolution requests can be directed to a single machine from any point on the network,

 The cache should be the size of the normal working data set of the application, 
 with some small amount of additional memory for unusual situations.[br]
 (Note: the working set is not the same as the number of pages accessed simultaneously, and is usually 
 much larger.)[br]
The value specified for this parameter is the maximum value that your application will be able to use for your in-memory cache. If your application does not have enough data to fill up the amount of space specified here, then your application will only use the amount of memory required by the data that your application does have.
For the DB, the default cache size is 8MB.[br]
You cannot specify a cache size value of less than 100KB.[br]
Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25% to account for cache overhead;
 cache sizes larger than 500MB are used as specified.[br]
 The maximum size of a single cache is 4GB on 32-bit systems and 10TB on 64-bit systems.[br]
 (All sizes are in powers-of-two, that is, 256KB is 2^18 not 256,000.)[br]
It is possible to specify cache sizes large enough they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures.[br]
 For example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may be allocated contiguously by a 
 process.[br]
If ncache is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated contiguously in memory.[br]
If it is greater than 1, the cache will be split across ncache separate regions, where the region size 
is equal to the initial cache size divided by ncache.[br]
The cache size supplied to this parameter will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the region size and 
may not be larger than the maximum possible cache size configured for your application 
(use the set_cache_max to do this).[br]
The ncache parameter is ignored when resizing the cache.

and the initial cache size specified in three parts: the gigabytes of cache, the additional bytes of cache,and the number of caches, also separated by whitespace characters.

Trusted in this case means that relay hosts on these networks are considered to not be potentially operated by spammers,
open relays, or open proxies.
[br]
A trusted host could conceivably relay spam, but will not originate it, and will not forge header data.[br]
DNS blacklist checks will never query for hosts on these networks.[br]
MXes for your domain(s) and internal relays should also be specified using the internal networks setting.[br]
When there are 'trusted' hosts that are not MXes or internal relays for your domain(s) they should only be specified in trusted networks.[br]
If a /mask is specified, it's considered a CIDR-style 'netmask', specified in bits.[br]
If it is not specified, but less than 4 octets are specified with a trailing dot, that's considered a mask to allow
all addresses in the remaining octets.[br]
If a mask is not specified, and there is not trailing dot, then just the single IP address specified is used, as if the mask was /32.
If a network or host address is prefaced by a ! the network or host will be excluded (or included) in a first listed match fashion.[br]

The auto-whitelist, aka automatic whitelist or AWL, tracks scores for your regular correspondents in a small on-disk database.[br]
In 3.1, it is a plugin, loaded by default in the file v310.pre.[br]
The AWL is actually a very simple system.[BR]
In short, the AWL is a score averaging system.[BR]
It keeps track of the historical average of a sender, and pushes any subsequent mail towards that average.[br]
So if someone that never sent you mail before sends you a mail that scores 20, and then sends you a second mail that would score 2.0 without the AWL,
the AWL will push the score up to 11 on the second mail.[br]
This is auto blacklisting, based on their past history of spam.[br]
If that same person sent you a mail that scored 0, and then later sent one that scored 7,
the AWL would push the score down to 3.5.[br]
This is auto-whitelisting based on past history of nonspam.[br]
A "sender" is identified using both the address they sent with, and their IP address, so spam claiming to be From you with forged headers will fail to get through.[br]
But the "auto whitelist" isn't really a whitelist per-se. [br]
It does however have a "learning white/blacklist" type behavior as a result of its averaging.[br]
Sometimes it may appear that the AWL is assigning scores the wrong way;

Discrimination behaviour is enabled by the 'discrimination' configuration variable in sqlgrey.conf
[br]
[H5]Default[/H5]

By default discrimination is set to 'off'. [br]
SQLgrey will apply greylisting (with the default whitelisting and auto-whitelisting described in the HOWTO) to every message.[br]
By default 'discrimination add rule number' is 'off'.[br]
If set to on, the greylist reply to the client will have the rule number added to the end  of the rejection text. (eg. 'Greylisted for 5 minutes (2)').
[br]
[H5]Discrimination[/H5]
Discrimination based greylisting is only usefull if you DO NOT want to greylist everybody.
[br]There may be several reasons for this.[br]
For example it can be used as a soft transistion to start greylisting, slowly  over time  making it more and more restrictive. [br]
Or it can help you convince management to allow you to do greylisting by explaining that you'd only greylist "anything suspicous" and thus, not your own  customers.
[br]

[H5]Discrimination - what is it?[/H5]

This feature was pretty hard to find a name for, but discrimination describes pretty well what it does. It discriminates ;).

I think of it as "the airport principle".[br] Everybody is let onto the plane UNLESS they find you suspicous.
You might have long hair,wear a turban, have dark skin or simply wearing a t-shirt saying  "explosive" or "GNU rocks".
[br]Then you will, by discrimination, be held back for further analysis. (im not saying it fair, its just a very good example)
[br]
The same principle applies here.
[br]Everyone is whitelisted UNLESS they look suspicous.[br]
If so, they have to go through greylisting.[br]
What is suspicous is defined in the discrimination.regexp file.[br]
In here one defines regular expression that will be used to check different attributes.[br]
[br][br]
Example:[br]
sender =~ @microsoft.com$
[br][br]
This line simply defines, that if the senders address ends on microsoft.com, its suspicous and thus will be greylisted.[br]
[br][br]
Another example:[br]
sender !~ ^(god|allah|jesus)@heaven.com$[br]
[br][br]
Note the !~ which means "anything that does NOT match, is suspicous".[br]
In this particular example we say: "We trust god, allah or jesus sending from heaven.com, but EVERYONE else will be greylisted."[br]

[br]
[H5]Rule Details[/H5]
The rules in /discrimination.regexp are defines by the following triplet:
[br]
[br]attribute comparison-operator regex[br]
[br]Valid comparison operators are:[br]
[br]=~ 	Equal to
[br]!~	Not Equal to
[br]
Valid attributes are anyhing sent from postfix to the policy deamon,but the ill explain the most common (and usefull) here:
[ul]
[li]sender		= the From address (from MAIL FROM:)[/li]
[li]recipient	= the recipients mail address (from RCPT TO:)[/li]
[li]client_address	= IP address of the client[/li]
[li]client_name	= Reverse-dns name of the client[/li]
[li]helo_name	= The text entered as "helo text"[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
Valid regular expression are simply perl compatable regular expressions.[br]
(without the "/" in beginning and end).[br]
[br]
[H5]Configuration directive: discrimination add rule number[/H5]

enable adds the rule number of the rule that caused the greylisting to the end of the rejection text, like this:[br]
 [i]Greylisted for 5 minutes (2)[/i][br]
In this case, 2 means the second (valid) regular expression in the file,caused the greylisting.[br]
This feature is to allow the support department to help customers figure out why, if their mail gets greylisted.[br]

[br]
[H5]Rule tips[/H5]
Its hard to define what is worthy of another look, and its definently not a 100% solution. [br]
If you have the guts and/or oppotunity, you should go with normal greylisting.[br]
I look often at our maillog and by doing so, start to see patterns to what spam looks like.
[br]You should do the same to find out whats good for greylisting, but some general tips are:[br]
[ul]
[li]missing reverse-dns[/li]
[li]mails from microsoft, fbi, paypal, ebay and the likes[/li]
[li]NULL senders. (blank sender address)[/li]
[li]mailaddresses with special chars (eg. $ or *)[/li]
[/ul][br]
The first one takes alot of the trash. So does NULL senders, but be advised that NULL senders are also legaly used in bounce mails.[br]

[H5]Performance guidelines[/H5]

It doesnt take much to do this check if you keep your list of expressions within reasonable limits.
[br]Actually this feature should be a performance saver, as it takes away a bunch of sql load, depending on how much you discriminate.[br]
[br]
This function is being used in a real-life scenario with ~100.000 accounts being checked by 10 regular expressions.[br]
There is no measurable perfomance loss.[br]

SQLgrey behaviour depends on the 'optmethod' configuration variable in sqlgrey.conf
By default Optin/Optout is set to 'none'.[br]
SQLgrey will apply greylisting (with the default whitelisting and auto-whitelisting described in the HOWTO) to every message.
[br]

If Optin/Optout is set to either 'optin' or 'optout', SQLgrey will check four tables to decide if the greylisting must be used.[br]
These four tables are:
[ul]
[li]optin_domain[/li]
[li]optin_email[/li]
[li]optout_domain[/li]
[li]optout_email[/li]
[/ul]

They each have only one column with either a domain name or a full email address (stored as a VARCHAR(255)).
[br]
[br][i][b]the content of each of these table *MUST* be *lowercased*.[br] SQLgrey always use lowercased address internally and for
performance reasons won't ask the database to check for different cases.[/b][/i]
[br]
If 'optin' is used, SQLgrey will only greylist in two cases:
[ul]
[li]the domain is in optin_domain AND the address isn't in optout_email,[/li]
[li]the address is in optin_email.[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
If 'optout' is used, SQLgrey won't greylist in two cases:
[ul]
[li]the domain is in optout_domain AND the address isn't in optin_email,[/li]
[li]the address is in optout_email.[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
[b][i]
SQLgrey doesn't check if the 4 tables' content is consistent. [br]
For example you should make sure that an address isn't both in optin_email and optout_email which doesn't make sense (SQLgrey won't crash but its
behaviour can change between versions).[/i]
[/b]
[br][br]
[H5]Performance guidelines[/H5]
For maximum performance, you should use the method which will use the least table entries.[br]
If nearly all your users want greylisting, you'll have better performance with 'optout'. If all of them want it without exception, use 'none'.[br]

If the needs of your users change between domains, use one of the optin/out_domain tables to set defaults (depending on the optmethod) by domain and add exceptions in the optin/out_email tables. This will
lower the number of entries in the database and help with performance.
[br]
[br][H5]Long email addresses[/H5]

For portability, addresses are limited to 255 characters. If you have users with addresses of more than 255 characters,
you'll have to trim the addresses the same way SQLgrey does: simply take the 255 first characters of the address leaving the rest out.[br]
If you have several users with the same 255 first characters, then it won't work properly (obviously the last user modified will set the
behaviour for the group beginning with the same characters).[br] As addresses of this size are pretty uncommon, the risk of collisions is probably only theoric though.

SQLgrey can tell Postfix to:[br]
[ul]
[li]immediately reject a message with a temporary reject code[/li]
[li]only do so if following rules would allow the message to pass [br]
[/ul][br]
The first choice will prevent Postfix from spending time evaluating potentially expensive rules.[br]
In some cases you may want following rules to be aware of the connection this.[br]

[br]We can specify a different rejection strategy for the first connection attempt, and for early reconnections.
