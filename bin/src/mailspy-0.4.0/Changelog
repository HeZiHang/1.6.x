0.4.0
06-05-09
	Major change - changed to using dir /var/log/mailspy instead of
	files in /var/log.  This solves the problem where running as the
	user mailspy causes log rotation to fail.

	Also a migration routine 
		cronspy.sh migrate-from-old-logfiles
		cronspy.sh regen
		cronspy.sh redo-log-rotation
		cat /var/log/mailspy.* | cronspy.sh regen-split-logs-stdin 

05-04-29
	Changed "Fri" to "5" because Fedora seems think "Fri" should be
	"Friday", which is not portable (I think).

05-03-22
	Added /usr/local/bin to rcscript. 

05-03-04 10:18
	Added "excludelocalmail" option to config file so that we can report
	only outside traffic (which is all that some people are interested in).
	Redhatted the startup script

03-01-14 09:16:12 
	Miscellaneous mods to RC files, and new mailspy.m4 to demonstrate
	how it's all done.

02-08-15 18:05:29
	Making departmental summaries -- each department gets its own directory
	if it has a list file for its users.

02-07-26 21:55:07
	Used <BASE HREF="../"> and put domain mail, individual mail, and logs
	in separate directories.  (If you feel like making files named
	mail/j/jo/joe/joeuser.example.com, feel free to modify the code.)

02-07-25 12:00:15
	Declared to be version 0.2.0

02-07-01 10:06:05
	Generated report dates are now in a NOWRAP table element. Much cuter.

Wed Apr  3 18:50:38 SAST 2002
	Added log message to process functionality, making it possible to
	log a message to a procmail-controlled mailbox (v. cute, sez I)

Wed Jan 23 15:20:00 SAST 2002
	Visual: moved `Mail from' and `Mail to' to inside the table so that
	the columns line up.
	Got it right the second time .. 17:36

Mon Jan 21 09:07:21 SAST 2002
	Bug: log rotation did not set ownership on /var/log/mailspy if the last
	file did not exist.

Thu Jan 17 21:35:41 SAST 2002
	Made an word mangler thingy so I can finally upload an example to the
	website.

Wed Jan 16 20:45:29 SAST 2002
	Many changes:
	Separate incoming vs outgoing addresses in the log
	Show totals in the user log
	Have a favourite domain to separate from other domains
	Show all details in sorted list
	Sort by clicking on a column heading
	Initial screen is the top offenders screen
	Chop subject lines and email addresses to fit in one line (usually)

Thu Nov  1 15:32:55 SAST 2001
	htmlspy.pl now logs all mails for each address and domain
	hmmm .. maybe it's time to put it in a database and make sql queries
	cronspy.sh now has a settable history limit ...

Mon Oct 29 16:39:58 SAST 2001
	Fixed up cronspy to do proper rotation

Thu Oct  4 16:36:18 SAST 2001
	Figured out why there were too many attachment names.  Duh.

Sat Sep 29 08:12:01 SAST 2001
	Hmm.  Most mail is junk.
