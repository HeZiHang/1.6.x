<sect>Introduction
<p>
	mailspy is a sendmail milter program (mail filter).
	For each mail that is filtered, the the sender,
	recipient, subject line and attachment names are logged.
	<p>
	mail headers can be logged to a file.
	<p>
	mailspy can also pipe messages to a process.  You can use
	procmail to archive selected message headers or bodies.  If you
	can concieve of something else useful that you can do with
	a stream of message headers and bodies, you can do that too.

<sect>Installation
<p>
Check that you have MILTER support in your distribution of <tt>sendmail</tt>
otherwise, obtain a version of <tt>sendmail</tt> with milter support. You should
have something like this.
<tscreen><verb>
foo:~ $ sendmail -d < /dev/null | grep -A5 "Compiled"
 Compiled with: DNSMAP HESIOD HES_GETMAILHOST LDAPMAP LOG MAP_REGEX
                MATCHGECOS MILTER MIME7TO8 MIME8TO7 NAMED_BIND NETINET NETINET6
                NETUNIX NEWDB NIS PIPELINING SASL SCANF STARTTLS TCPWRAPPERS
                USERDB USE_LDAP_INIT
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
<p>
The main targets for the make file are:
<descrip>
<tag>make all</tag>
	Compile C source to executable.  Requires sendmail libmilter
	header files and libraries.
<tag>make install</tag>
	Install files in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>.  You can set the <tt>DESTDIR</tt>
	variable if you want to install files in a different root directory.
<tag>make start</tag>
	Try to mangle your <tt>/etc/mail/linux.mc</tt> (m4 source file) into
	<tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt> and start mailspy.
	This appends mailspy filter rules to <tt>/etc/mail/linux.mc</tt> and run
	it through <tt>m4</tt> to produce <tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt>.
	Also installs and creates links in <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> and
	<tt>/etc/init.d/rc3.d</tt>.
<tag>make dist</tag>
	Make distribution in tar.gz format.
</descrip>

If <tt>make start</tt> doesn't do it for you on your system, you
might be using something other than SuSE Linux 7.2 / 7.3.  Send me a patch that
makes it work for your system, and I'll see what I can do.  <tt>make
install</tt> installs the binaries, but does not configure sendmail to use the
filter, and does not create links in /etc/init.d to make sure that the program works.
<p>
If you don't have sendmail libraries and header files installed, you are 
going to struggle just a little.  You will have to install sendmail-devel (d4
series on SuSE 8.0) in order for this to work.  If you are using sendmail-8.11
or so, you will need to uncomment -lsfio in the Makefile.
<p>
The program installs in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> by default (and
you can't change this either).  The default mailspy startup file
listens on a unix socket <tt>/var/run/mailspy/milter</tt> and
logs mail details to <tt>/var/log/mailspy/mailspy</tt>.  If you want to
log mail headers, you have to specify a log file yourself.
<p>
The program appends to the end of the log files.  To rotate the log
files there is a program called cronspy.sh which should do the trick, and
which should be runnable as a user `mailspy', although this has never really
been established.
<p>
<sect>Usage
<p>
The usage for mailspy is:
<tscreen><verb>
./mailspy -p socket [-f logfile] [-h headerlog] [-P pipe-msg-to-cmd]
</verb></tscreen>
The items are:
<descrip>
<tag>-p /var/run/mailspy/milter</tag>
	The socket specifies how mailspy connects to the sendmail process it is
	spying on, you can specify a unix socket (a named pipe) or an IPV4 or
	IPV6 socket. 
<tag>-f /var/log/mailspy/mailspy</tag>
	The log file records messages in terms of the envelope sender and
	recipient, and also the subject and attachment names.  The particular
	log format is only understood by <tt>htmlspy.pl</tt>.
<tag>-h /var/log/mailspy/headers</tag>
	If you want to log only headers of each message, then this is one
	way to do it.
<tag>-P procmail</tag>
	All mail can be piped to a process. If mailspy is running as the user
	`mailspy', then the contents of <tt>~mailspy/.procmailrc</tt> will
	determine what happens with each message. Using procmail rules you
	can archive messages, forward selected messages to arbitary recipients,
	and do any amount of interesting things.  <bf>Note: If the process
	fails to handle the message, the error is ignored.</bf>
	<p>
	If you use procmail delivery together with a global
	<tt>/etc/procmailrc</tt>, you may find that procmail does not deliver
	the mail quickly enough, and you get sporadic 451 message failures.
	This happens if you use the anomy sanitizer from procmail.  The
	solution is not to do this.

<sect>Questions (without answers)
<p>
Coming soon to this paragraph (erm), answers to your questions --
<itemize>
<item>Why would I want this program (to see who's talking to whom, and 
	what they are up to)
<item>Can I use this with my anti-virus program (yes) (but don't ask us about
	anti-virus).
<item>Can I use this with other mail programs than sendmail (no, unless you set
	up sendmail as an intermediate relay)
<item>Can I archive message bodies (yes, using procmail)
<item>What program can I use to process the log files (htmlspy). If you logged
	the message bodies, you can use imap to read the log files.
<item>Is it morally right to spy on people's mail (of course not)
<item>Are there legal issues (not just a few)
<item>It doesn't work on my system - will you fix it (we may if you will pay)
<item>I used your program and sendmail says ``4.7.1 Try again later'' - when is
	later? (sendmail can't talk to the mailspy program ... you'll have to
	fix it - see previous question.)
<item>Help, I broke my system! (You broke your system.)
</itemize>

<sect>Legal issues
<p>
Does your company, country, state, municipality or local mafia
boss permit the logging of e-mail?  Do you have to notify people
that their e-mail is being logged?  Does logging the e-mail 
imply a responsibilty on you to read the log?  It turns out we
don't know.
<p>
No statement is made about the legal implications of using this
program (except for this statement, which says there is nothing
to say).  If you need to know, consult a real live legal
practitioner.  I am not a lawyer.  (And the chances are there is
some really great page out there will all of this information on
for all countries...)
<p>
Another thing -- this program is licenced under the GNU General
Public License.
