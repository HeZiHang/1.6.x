# Here's a procmailrc that logs messages to a today and a discarded file.  It
# fully expects to have a cron job run regularly to keep things orderly
# (cronspy.sh daily won't do it, actually).  If you want to delete
# old mails, here's where.
#
# mailspy -p '/var/run/mailspy/milter' -P 'procmail mailspy-procmailrc'
#
# or (if you install this file as ~mailspy/.procmailrc), then
# 
# mailspy -p /var/run/mailspy/milter -P procmail
#

VERBOSE=yes
HOST=eml
DATE=`date +%y%m%d`
DEFAULT=$HOME/mail/.$DATE/

# Alternatively, select certain mails:
#:0:
#* ^(From|To|Cc|Bcc):.*(automotive-online.co.za|auctron.co.za|auctron.net|auctron.com|autoferret.co.za)
#Mail/today
#
#:0:
#Mail/discarded

# Discard zero-length messages (interrupted during transmission)
# For good measure, we'll discard truly micro messages not handled by anybody
