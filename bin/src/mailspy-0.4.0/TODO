	Mailspy should be split into a few components:
	- Milter: snarf headers and occasionally message bodies
	- formail mbox: read mbox input from milter and create a log file for
	  htmlspy i.e. the script will read input from either the milter, or from
	  selected lines (triggered via procmail), or a mbox like "formail -s
	  mailspyfilter < mbox"
	- logfile filter: read sendmail or postfix logs and create a log file
	  for htmlspy

	We should make the thing able to process BSD mailboxes.  Now *that*
	would be useful.  (This was suggested on GLUG ... but not in connection
	with mailspy).

	rcmailspy reload does kill -9, since nothing else seems to work.
	We should really have a look at this, since it could be the cause
	of sendmail consuming maximum CPU usage ... or maybe sendmail just
	went crazy all by itself?

	The installation needs to be checked on a fresh computer.  Volunteers?
