- We now follow the following rules:
1) Je récupère la conf,
- je regarde le temps minimal entre 2 mesures (T_MIN) (que ca soit
ping/ul/dl)
- je fait une pause de 0 a 10% de T_MIN
Cela évite que 5000 client après avoir recup la conf innonde le serveur de
mesure

2) La grenouille peut pas se connecter pour la Nieme fois
- Je fait une pause de N*0.2*T_MIN
Si N > 5 alors N=5

Et si jamais la grenouille ne connaît pas T_MIN alors pause de N*2+5
minutes, avec N>15 -> N=15
