0.1.19 Release
------------

Once installation has been completed, you can edit your httpd.conf and add
'Include <path>/amavis-stats.alias.conf' at the end.

A look at `man amavis-stats' will list the paths of all files installed in
the 'FILES' section.


New features/fixes:

-) added a graph to display the breakdown of non-virus message statistics.

-) truncate virus names to 32 character.
